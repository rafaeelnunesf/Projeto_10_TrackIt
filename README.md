## TrackIt
This project is about a simple habit tracking app.

## Why?
My main focus when developing this code was to practice the following subjects:
- React
- Styled Components
- Context API
- Local Storage
- How to make a Login and user registration screen

I also wanted to practice importing libraries to use in my project
